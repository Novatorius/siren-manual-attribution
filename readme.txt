Manually attribute offline sales to affiliates and keep your commission reporting accurate.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [Siren Affiliates](https://www.sirenaffiliates.com?ref=SRN) in order to function.

Not every sale happens through your website, but your affiliates should still get credit when they help close the deal.

Siren Affiliates – Manual Affiliate Payouts lets you manually attribute transactions to affiliates from a dedicated *
*Transactions** screen in Siren. Log offline conversions (in-person sales, phone orders, invoices, etc.), attach them to
an affiliate, and let your existing programs and engagement triggers handle rewards and reporting exactly as if the sale
happened online.

Because it uses Siren’s native engagement trigger strategies, manual transactions flow through the same award logic,
caps, and commission rules you’ve already set up.

### Manual Affiliate Payouts allows you to:

1. Record offline or custom transactions directly inside Siren.
2. Manually attribute one or more transactions to a specific affiliate.
3. Create new transactions with a simple transaction builder interface.
4. Apply program-specific manual engagement triggers so only the right programs fire.
5. Keep affiliate stats, commissions, and reports accurate across online and offline sales.
6. Give high-touch partners and small, relationship-driven affiliates the credit they deserve.

## What is Siren Affiliates?

Siren Affiliates is a powerful affiliate management system for your WordPress website. It integrates with major
eCommerce, LMS, and membership plugins, allowing you to create and manage a comprehensive affiliate program with ease.
With Siren Affiliates, you can track referrals, manage commissions, and empower your affiliates to promote your
products.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does this plugin require Siren Affiliates?**
Yes. This is an extension for Siren Affiliates and will not function without Siren installed and activated.

**Can I use this to track payouts without using Siren’s normal programs and rules?**
No. This plugin doesn’t replace Siren’s award logic — it plugs into it. Manual transactions still run through your
existing programs, engagement triggers, and commission rules.

**What kinds of transactions can I attribute manually?**
Any transaction you can log in the Transactions screen: in-person sales, phone orders, invoices, custom offline deals,
or any online order that wasn’t automatically attributed to an affiliate.

**Does this only work with WooCommerce?**
No. Manual transactions are handled at the Siren level, so they can represent conversions from any integration Siren
supports (WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, LifterLMS, memberships, or anything else wired into Siren), or no
extension at all with manual transaction creation.

**How are commissions calculated for manual transactions?**
Manual transactions still follow the commission rules and engagement trigger strategies you’ve configured for your
programs. If a program would normally award a commission for that type of conversion, it will do the same for manually
attributed transactions.

**Can I bulk-attribute multiple transactions to the same affiliate?**
Yes. From the Transactions screen, you can select multiple transactions and use the manual attribution action to assign
them to a single affiliate in one step.

**Can I change or revoke a manual attribution later?**
Manual attributions create awards just like any other transaction in Siren. If you adjust or revoke awards using Siren’s
standard tools, those changes will also affect awards created from manual attributions.
